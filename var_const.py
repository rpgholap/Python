# Variables: are the containers that store information
# How to declare the variables: 
    1. snake_case (also decalre like this)
    2. start with lowercase or uppercase
    3. letters,numbers,underscores can be used 
    4. Case sensitive
    5.Don't overwrite keywords
    
# Constants : always is in captial latters (all letters should be capital)
# Ex. PI = 3.14
# if we want to change the value of constant then assign the value of constant to zero
i.e. PI=0

'''
us4er_iq = 190  #iq is a variable, can be used in later in a program
print(us4er_iq)
iq = us4er_iq/4
print(iq)

print = 190
print(print) # can not write built in function for naming the variables
#o/p : <built-in function print>

PI = 3.14  # constant

# we can declare multiple variable / we can assign a variable to multiple values
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
